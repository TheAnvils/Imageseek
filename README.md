# Imageseek
Imageseek is a compact image search engine made to bypass all restrictions. Guess what? It's only one python file! It uses https://serpapi.com so if you don't have an account you can make one for free, just keep in mind that it only allows for 100 searches per month.
# How to use
It's very simple, just run the pyton file, copy your api key and write what you want to search! Now, go to localhost port 8080 on your web browser and view the images. Useful for I don't know I just wanted to make a search engine.
